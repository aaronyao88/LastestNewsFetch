While there’s still some time to go before November 28th, we’ve already found a healthy selection of early discounts, allowing you to get a jump on your holiday shopping. Right now, for instance, the new AirPods Pro 3 are receiving their first sizable discount. Meanwhile, Google’s Pixel Watch 4 — the Android watch to beat — is on sale for the first time. However, that’s just a taste of what’s to come in November. As the month goes on, we’re expecting to see even more deals — including sizable drops on robovacs, TVs, and headphones. In fact, retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have already kicked off their holiday promos. We’ll be updating this guide over the next week or so, too, so be sure to check back as we approach the main event.
